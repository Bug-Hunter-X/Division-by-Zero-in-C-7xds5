# Division by Zero Bug in C
This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains code that attempts to divide an integer by zero, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero errors.

## Running the code
You can compile and run the code using a C compiler like GCC:

```bash
gcc bug.c -o bug
./bug
```

```bash
gcc bugSolution.c -o bugSolution
./bugSolution
```
